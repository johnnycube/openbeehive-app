// A tiny reactivity signal that bridges the (plain-TS) sync engine to Svelte
// pages. The engine bumps it after a pull applies remote changes; pages read it
// inside an $effect so their queries re-run when fresh data lands — e.g. on the
// first app load (local DB empty until the initial pull) or live multi-device
// sync. Local writes already reload their own page, so only remote applies bump.
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

// True until this device is known to hold a full replica (first Pull done, or
// the cursor proves an earlier one did) — or until sync gives up (offline,
// error). While true, an empty local table means "unknown", not "empty":
// pages show a syncing hint instead of their empty-state CTA, so a fresh
// device or the demo never flashes "create your first apiary" during the
// initial download. Flipped by the sync engine (sync.ts).
